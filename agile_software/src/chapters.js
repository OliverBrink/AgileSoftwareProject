Jet skiing is a popular recreational activity that involves riding on a personal watercraft, also known as a jet ski. Jet skis are small, motorized boats that are propelled by a jet of water that is created by a pump and an impeller. Jet skis are typically operated by a single rider, but some models can accommodate two or more passengers. Jet skis are often used for recreational purposes, such as water sports, sightseeing, and fishing. They can also be used for commercial purposes, such as search and rescue operations, law enforcement, and military operations.'
