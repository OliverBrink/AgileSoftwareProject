What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
This weeks teamwork could have been a a little bit better, we worked two people together and kind of went our own way when problems occured
instead of comunicating and making a plan together. We both just wanted to fix it so that the code would work but the code just became messier
and messier. In the end, we could not solve the problem. 

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
Me and Lucas worked with adding a checkbox, the checkbox is now clickable but the connection to the right subchapter does not work. We tried to add 
the completed subchapters to an array but that did not work either. When the checkbox is 
clicked, all subchapters are marked as completed. We will work more on this in the next week. We also did some css. 


Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
We tried to estimate more carefully, but this weeks user stories still turned out to be harder than expected.
