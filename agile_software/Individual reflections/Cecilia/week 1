What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
How to categorize on a scrum board, I have read about it but I still find it a bit difficult to understand what 
categories to include and what to prioritize since we have a lot of userstories in the backlog and it's not posible to prioritize them all. 

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
My task was to create a button that changes page. And of course work together with the team to create user stories plan the sprint. 
We did pretty good this week I think. But maybe talk more in detail about each user story. 

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
This is the first.
