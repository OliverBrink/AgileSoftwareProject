What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
How big user stories are, I found out during this sprint that one of the user stories were a lot bigger than I, 
and probably the rest of the group, expected. I also want to understand how better how to connect the database to the pages in the reactproject. 


What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I was scrum-master this sprint and I held the sprint meetings and made sure that the scrum-board was handled correctly. 
I also tried to make sure everyone was happy with the user-stories they got, even though it's the whole groups responsibility to distribute the 
user stories. 


Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
We tried to focus more on making a goal for the sprint and then distribute user-stories, not the other way around. This weeks goal was parted in two 
and when we set the second goal we already said that maybe it was to much, which it also was. Next time we should make the goal a bit smaller if we 
have a feeling it might be to much.
