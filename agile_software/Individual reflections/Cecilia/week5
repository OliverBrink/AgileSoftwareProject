What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
Be better at javascript. It was really hard implementing some logic in javascript, it would have been much easier in for example java or 
python. And maybe be better at problem solving, it was very frustrating when we could not solve the problem and had spend hours on it. 
In the end we solved it using a different tactic, but it is hard to know when to discard a tacic and switch to another and when to keep
working on the method you are using. 

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I tried to implement an array to store read chapters in but it did not work so in the end my solution was thrown away. But I did 
help a bit with the other solution and with the checkbox. I also started writing a read-me file. 


Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
Trying different tactics. Talking more with the people I work with.
