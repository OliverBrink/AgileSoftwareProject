What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 

While my skills in web development has improved from last week, Rome wasn't built in a day. 

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

I actually felt like I could spot some small mistakes by other members, and correct them as I understood their purpose. I think for next sprint I should be able to 
acctually input my own thoughts.

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?

As mentioned, improvements but still capacity for more.
