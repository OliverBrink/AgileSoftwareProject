What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 

I have realised that as my understanding of Javascript has increased, I've become more prone to trying things on my own. I whould go back to 
what I did in the beginning of the project a bit, and rely more on the competencies of others.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

I feel like I didn't contribute too much this week. Me and Cecilia sat as a fron end pair this week, and we hit some roadblocks regarding the "done" checkbox. While we managed 
to get it done (ish), it still feels like it tool far longer than it should have. Not a great feeling. 

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?

Possibly a negative change, see above. However, it's quite likely that since both of us got stuck on it it's more to do with our JS unfamiliarity.
