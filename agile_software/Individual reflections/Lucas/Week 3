What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 

We still had some work to be done with some front end structuring, but next week we'll be diving into CSS and some more graphical details, 
which I don't have too much exprience with. It's been something I've been postphoning for a while, so I look forward to learning some. 

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

I feel like my contributions were on par with other memebers this week, with nothing much to comment on. I hope to improve even more next week, maybe even 
leading the charge with some graphical code. 

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?

A major step up from contribituing by noticing misstakes to actually being able to try my own code and ideas.
