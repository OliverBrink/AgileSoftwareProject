What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 

As the project is coming towards an end, I'd like to know a bit more about how to prioratize user stories when things have to be ignored in favor of usable features. 
I suppose the product owner would have a big say in this when working on a real, major project. But still, how does the product owner decide then?

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

With some clever googling and searching I felt like I contributed quite a lot in adding the checkbox-feature and making it work as intended. 

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?

Great improvements! It feels great to manage to work through the roadblock. Just some polish left, and then we have a (more than minimum) viable product!
