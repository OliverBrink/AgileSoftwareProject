What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 

My understanding of web development feels somewhat lacking. While not to the extent that I don't feel like I can't contribute, I strive to gain as much knowledge from 
the other members as possible. I do feel like I have some experience with agile processess, as a previous employer of mine had applied the agile mindset to our work, even though
we didn't directly work with software development. 

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

In order to help my team more, I intend to practice a bit on my web development skills. Since we work with pair programming, I have been able to assist with some concepts and logic,
but not really help with code syntax. 

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?

Since it's week 1, not quite possible.
