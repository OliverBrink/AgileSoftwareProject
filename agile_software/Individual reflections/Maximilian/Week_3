I need to learn how to connect the user database to the chapter database, as this will be 
neccessary in the future. I still need to learn javascript better, as I don't quite
know enough.

This week I contributed, along with Wilhelm and Oliver, to the database structure.
Specifically we implemented a database-access view for the administators so that they can add and
remove chapters.

Teamwork has worked well this week, however most of us were pretty busy with our bachelors thesis.
We split into to two groups, one with two people one with four. We decided to do this so that
the larger group coukd focus on the backend. Communication worked well.
