I want to learn firebase better. Also, databases in general, specifically how to practically implement them.
I still have much to learn about react and javascript too.

This week I contributed, along with Jonas and Oliver, to the database structure.
We primarily focused on the user database, and were able to succesfully implement firebase.
It is safe and easy to use, and I am satisfied with my contribution.

Overall, teamwork was even better this week. We split into groups of 3, which worked very well.
Communication within the groups, and between groups worked well.
