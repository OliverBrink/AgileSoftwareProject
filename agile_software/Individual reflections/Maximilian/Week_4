I still need to learn javascript better, however I would say that I have improved significantly since the beginning of the project.
Mainly I need to write better code, not just code that works.
Further, I would like to learn more about pair-programming, and I will take a look at the link Jonas sent out.

This week Jonas, Oliver and I tried to implement access-role (i.e. different users have different roles i.e. some are students, some are teachers etc.)
It proved to be very difficult and we did not make much progress, despite our best efforts. However, we do believe that we now have a better idea
of what we need to do next week and should (hopefully) be able to get it working. Once that is done, the rest of the features should be smooth sailing.

Teamwork worked very well this week, we split into three different groups working on separate features.
Our team of three focused on backend. Pair-programming has worked vell for us, it's much easier to write
good code when you work in pairs or groups. Often when we have single-person features the code some times 
ends up sloppy.
