1. I want to learn Scrum a little better. Sometimes or meetings feel a little unstructured.
I also want to learn React better. I have never worked in Javascript before, and it seems like a good place to start.

2. This week went well, I was paired up with Jonas to create a login page and we succeeded.  
Jonas did most of the work, next time I will try to contribute a little more. 
I contributed with a "forgot password" link that opens up an email to customer support and did some minor visual changes.

3. This is the first reflection.
