I feel as if I finally have a better grip on JavaScript, although much left to learn.
I would mainly ike to learn more about agile methodologies. Having worked with it for over a month, I am starting
to see the advantages of using it. It would be interesting to learn even more about more specific details, specifically more about scrum.
I feel as if we are still only scratching the surface of agile.

This week Jonas, Oliver and I finally were able to implement access-roles, and subsequently create different homepages for different types of users.
Although we had to deviate from our original plan it now works well. We originally planned to use Firebase's built in userTokens, although these proved 
to be very difficult so we instead used a user-database in firestore to store user-roles. This works fine, and we believe that it is relatively safe from
a cybersecurity perspective (although arguably not as safe as firebases userTokens).

Teamwork was once again good. There were some minor communication issues as we on the backend also implemented different homepages (which frontend were supposed to do).
However, this was the only way for us to test that our code worked. In retrospect we should have realized already at sprint-planning that the two user-stories overlapped.
However, we can still use the CSS code from frontend on our backend-homepages, so no big deal. Pair-programming again worked very well.
