What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
Since I have been working with Firebase and Firebase Admin SDK without really getting a 100% hang of it I want to learn more. I want to learn more about setting upp a Firebase Admin SDK server, and onnecting that to Firebase in order to create Custom Claims for the users.
Regarding the Agile Process I want to learn more about how you make sure that everybody works on separate tasks and not accidentally work on the same because of similar user stories. 


What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I have worked a lot with getting Firebase Admin SDK, but there has been many issues with getting it compatible with what we have already made so because of shortage of time we had to come up with a quicker solution. I have also helped with implementing the "ugly" solution that we have instead of working with Firebase Admin SDK. 

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
I have learned alot about firebase this week too. I have also learned about that it's possible to work on different user stories, but at the same time work with practically the same thing.
