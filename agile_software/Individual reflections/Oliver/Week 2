What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
I want to learn more about how to use databases for an application. I want to learn pros/cons for having local vs global (e.g. Firebase) databases and noSQL vs SQL.


What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I helped with implementing authentication with Firebase. I also helped with creating a JSON database. I can continue in being proactive and work with the user stories.

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
No, not really.
