What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
More or less the same as last week. I want to learn more about how to utilise Google's Firebase in a software like ours. 
I also want to learn more about how to think/handle building framework/groundwork when working agile, since there is a risk of working a lot with a framework before it is possible to actually test it in a meaningful way.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I helped with creating a JSON database in Firebase and connecting it to our software. I'm not really sure, we seem to have a solid teamwork and communication. 

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
No, not really.
