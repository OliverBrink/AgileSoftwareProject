What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
I have learnt alot about firebase, and I do believe that it is a very potent tool. Therefore I want to learn even more about firebase, since I think it would be very useful if I would like to build something on my own in the future. 

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I have sadly been ill this whole week. But I have been trying to help with creating a way to differentiate between different roles for users (admin, user, etc) by using firebase and creating "custom claims". 
Which sadly as very difficult, but hopefully we will be able to resolve it next week. 

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
I have learnt alot about firebase and it's different functions. I have learned more about backend/clientside is and how one should think about the two concepts.
